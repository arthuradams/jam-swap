Solution with 1 div and NO transparent image:

You can use the multibackground CSS3 feature and put two backgrounds: one with the image, another with a transparent panel over it (cause I think there's no way to set directly the opacity of the background image):

background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7) 0%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7) 100%), url(bg.png) repeat 0 0, url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon.png) repeat 0 0;

background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, rgba(255,255,255,0.7) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0.7) 100%), url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon.png) repeat 0 0;

background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%,rgba(255,255,255,0.7)), color-stop(100%,rgba(255,255,255,0.7))), url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon.png) repeat 0 0;
